# Essies Ltd Sales Analysis Project </br>
This project was executed to analyze the sales data of Essies Ltd's new product launch. The aim was to identify the sales trends in different segments of customers and regions.

# Data Preparation  </br>
To analyze the data, I created reference tables for the date and products. It was important to keep the product category table separate in the model. I also created a separate table for the product subcategory and prioritized the retail sales in terms of high, mid, and low categories. I included an interactive slicer for the country flag in the report. The following metrics were highlighted in the Essies Dashboard:  </br>

# Units Sold by Category  </br>
Total Unit sold  </br>
Retail Unit Sold  </br>
Sales Unit Sold  </br>
The top 10 retailers were highlighted in terms of unit sold. The top-performing products were also identified based on unit sold. The top-performing subcategories were identified based on unit sold.  </br>
